## Module: attack ####################################################

Module for carrying out an attack on a AMD ZenX CPU.
The glitch module will be used to carry out the actual attack.

## Commands

  <empty str>       Arms the attack, it will be performed when the next restart is detected.

## Paramters

  waits             The specified amount of chip-select low-pulses will be waited for,
                    before the glitch will be triggered.

## Module: glitch ####################################################

A glitch can either be triggered by an attack, by a chip-select
pulse (active-low) or manually. After being triggered we firstly
wait delay - duration many busy loop cycles. Then repeats many
times the following steps will be executed:
  - sets the configured vid (for the configured voltage)
  - wait duration many busy loop cycles
  - sets the configured default vid (in cmd_soc or cmd_core)
  - wait cooldown many busy loop cycles
Then the result detection starts:
  - wait for a low chip-select pulse
     -> if a pulse at most cs_timeout long is detected continue
     -> for a longer pulse we are in an error state
     -> with no pulse after ping_wait many busy loop cycles,
        the target is considered broken
  - wait for another chip-select pulse
     -> if detected the glitch is considered to be successful
     -> with no pulse after success_wait many busy loop cycles,
        the target is considered to be restarting

                    for the restart detection to consider the device under test
                    turned on, when it is turned off.

  wait_off          How many busy loop cycles does the SVD line needs to be low
                    for the restart detection to move the device under test

  offset_trim       Gives finer control over the voltages.
                    Possible value are: off, no_change, +25mV and -25mV.

  load_line         Controls the slope of the load line. When the cpu draws
                    higher currents the supply voltages drop, this is the
                    slope of the load line. The units are % mOhm and the
                    Possible values are: off, no_change, -40%, -20%, +20%,
                    +40%, +60% and +80%.

## Module: core_cmd ##################################################

An amd svi2 cmd/packet whose purpose it is to set the "normal" VCore
state of the voltage regulator. It is sent when a restart has been detected
or after a glitch with the "glitch" command.

## Paramters

  vid               The voltage level to set. Each vid step corresponds to a
                    -0.00625 Volt step. A vid of 0 corresponds to a voltage of
                    1.55 Volts and vids above 248 completely turn of the
                    voltages.
                    Note: This value might be protected from being set too high.

  power             Controls the low-power states. Possible values are:
                    low, mid, full_alt and full.
                    In full and full_alt all mosfets drive the bus, in
                    mid only a single phase is used and in low a diode
                    emulation mode is entered.

  offset_trim       Gives finer control over the voltages.
                    Possible value are: off, no_change, +25mV and -25mV.

  load_line         Controls the slope of the load line. When the cpu draws
                    higher currents the supply voltages drop, this is the
                    slope of the load line. The units are % mOhm and the
                    Possible values are: off, no_change, -40%, -20%, +20%,
                    +40%, +60% and +80%.

## Module: hw ########################################################

Controls which hardware components are used and how.

## Paramters

  config            Allows switching between the two configurations (1 and 2).

  trigger_restart   Whether the trigger pin pulses on a restart of the device
                    under test.

  trigger_glitch_broken
                    Whether the trigger pin pulses on a glitch that breaks the
                    device under test.

  trigger_glitch_success
                    Whether the trigger pin pulses on a glitch that succeeds.

  trigger_glitch_running
                    Whether the trigger pin pulses on a glitch where the system
                    continues running.

  trigger_glitch    Whether the trigger pin pulses on glitch activity.

  trigger_attack    Whether the trigger pin pulses on attack activity.

  trigger_cli       Whether the trigger pin pulses on cli activity (for debugging).

## Module: ping ######################################################

A small utility to check whether the
device is still responding.
